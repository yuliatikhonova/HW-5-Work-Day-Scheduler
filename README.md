For this project we were asked to create a simple work day schedule calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the work day.
We were asked to when opening the planner, the current day will be displayed at the top. For example:

![Opening planner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62128411/80907208-c2a30480-8cc9-11ea-9ee8-a97a092f653c.gif)

We had to make sure that when we scrolled down, we should present time blocks for standard business hours. Also each of the time blocks are color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. For example:

![Scroll and time color](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62128411/80907229-33e2b780-8cca-11ea-8a48-b17d42337325.gif)

Also when click onto a time block, we can enter an event. Then we can save that event, in local storage, by clicking on the save button. So when we refresh the site it the event will still be there. For example:

![Save event](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62128411/80907287-c1260c00-8cca-11ea-9c32-5caf356dab53.gif)

I also put in a button that will clear the full schedule. For example:

![Clear schedule](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62128411/80907308-f3d00480-8cca-11ea-90b1-d31aa6b1917a.gif)
